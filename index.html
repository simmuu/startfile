        <button class="accordion"><strong>History</strong></button>
        <div class="panel">
         <p>Since its inception in 2014, Diane's Run has grown from a purely local event involving
            100 runners to a signature Wyoming event with more than 2000 participants annually.
            The event is enormously effective in spreading the message that breast cancer need 
            not be fatal if caught early enough with mammography and regular breast self-exams. 
            As well as a top-flight athletic event, Diane's Run is an emotionally moving event
            attracting many first timers and recreational runners. This event provides all of 
            us with the opportunity to spread a hopeful message about breast cancer to our families
            and our communities.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion"><strong>Remembering Diane</strong></button>
        <div class="panel">
         <p>Diane's Run is named in remembrance of Diane Wheaton, mother of two and wife
            of Peter, who passed away in May, 2013. Diane was an outspoken advocate of physical
            fitness and healthy living. She was an inspiration to all who knew her and continues
            to be an inspiration to the thousands of runners who have participated in this event.</p>
            
            <p>We hope you can join us this year and become part of the Diane's Run family.</p>
